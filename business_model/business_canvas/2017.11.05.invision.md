## InVision

### Short Description
InVision is a service built for designers, that lets these creatives not only draw out their ideas for apps or websites, but actually build the prototype to look, feel, and act like the actual product, even without all the back-end engineering.

For bigger companies who use the enterprise InVision platform, users can send designs out to various teams or company-wide to get feedback in real time in a way that doesn’t send engineers back to the drawing board.

InVision’s goal is to be for product-based communication what Slack is for general corporate communication and Atlasssian or GitHub is for engineering-based communication.
