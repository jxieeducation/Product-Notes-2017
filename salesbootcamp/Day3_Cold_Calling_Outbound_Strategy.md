## Outbounding Strategy

* reason for email
  * why you? why you now?
* subject lines
  * goal is to get prospect to read your email
  * A/B test!!!
* 3 types of emails
  * fishing with nets vs spears - mass email -> semi-personalized -> personalized
* timing and freq of campaigns
  * hit them a lot 12-18 touches within 2 weeks
* outbound emails should have 3 parts:
  * why are you emailing you?
  * what's in it for me?
  * what are you asking for?
* Good email example:
  * Hi Jill,
  * I recently read a Wall Street Journal article that mentioned your CMO is passionate about using Machine Learning to personalize mass email templates. I'm reaching out because Boomtrain works with major consumer brands such as Pepsi, Nike and Macy's to drive a 3x improvement in email click through by sending personalized and relevant content in their newsletter.
  * Do you have a few minutes next Tuesday at 10pm or 3pm PT for me to share more details about the results we drive for Fortune 500 companies such as Walmart? 
  * I look forward to connecting.
* types of outbound emails:
  * personal referral email
    * mention recent event
    * ask for person in charge
  * website referral email
    * "I came across your website and noticed that your company might be facining similar challenges"
    * semi-automated
  * show your work email
    * "Hi, my companies have done this and might help you"
    * show blog / industry insight / biz website that demonstrate the problem
  * value prop email
    * give them value! e.g. I heard this news, this might help
    * hope to build a relationship from there
  * highlight solution email
    * here's what my company does, does it help?
  * share case study email
    * show off your work and try to get a meeting
  * voicemail follow up email
    * I just called, describe why you try to connect



## Social Selling

* social selling is the art of developing or cultivating relationships as part of sales process such as linkedin



## Intro to Cold Calling

* selling is primarily over the phone
* should leave voicemail in the beginning (not after like 10 touches)
  * can reference the voicemail in emails afterwards
* inbound vs outbound call
* can save a lot of time crafting good email messages if you can just get on the phone with someone



## Breakthrough Statement

* example call script
  * "Hello, is this Sally Smith?"
  * "Hi Sally, this is Ryan Reisert, Sales Acceleration Consultant with ZenProspect, how are you doing today?"
  * "Did I catch you at a bad time?"
  * "We help growing companies find and win new business faster by identifying, analyzing and engaging your future customers in a single, unified platform."
  * "Do you have a few minutes to discuss how your team currently finds, engages and brings on new business?"
* **Note: I can totally do this practice with charities**
* Breakthrough script:
  * "Hi, I'm Ryan Reisert, Sales Acceleration Consultant at ZenProspect. I know I'm an interruption; can I have 27 seconds to tell you why I called?"
  * "I believe we have discovered a breakthrough in eliminating 100% of the time wasted for new business prospecting and acquisition."
  * "The reason I reached out to you today is to get a few minutes on your calendar to share that breakthrough with you."
  * "Do you happen to have your calendar available?"
* Note: Cold call, asked a question (did not pitch right away)
